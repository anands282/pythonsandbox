## Introduction

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of dynamic programming, covering key concepts, common problem types, and example solutions.

## Key Concepts

Before diving into problems and solutions, it's important to understand the key concepts of dynamic programming:

- **Overlapping Subproblems**: Problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems which are solved independently.
- **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution of the problem can be constructed efficiently from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.
- **Memoization**: A top-down approach where results of expensive function calls are cached and reused.
- **Tabulation**: A bottom-up approach where results of subproblems are stored in a table and used to construct the solution to the overall problem.

## Types of Problems

Dynamic programming is used to solve various types of problems, including but not limited to:

- **Optimization Problems**: Problems that require finding the maximum or minimum value (e.g., the longest increasing subsequence, the shortest path).
- **Combinatorial Problems**: Problems that involve counting ways to do something (e.g., the number of ways to climb stairs, the number of ways to partition a set).
- **Decision Problems**: Problems that involve making decisions to achieve a goal (e.g., knapsack problem, coin change problem).

## Common DP Problems

Here are some common dynamic programming problems you will encounter:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**
2. **Longest Common Subsequence**
3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**
4. **0/1 Knapsack Problem**
5. **Coin Change Problem**
6. **Edit Distance**
7. **Matrix Chain Multiplication**
